## Active Context

### Recent Changes
1. Fixed TypeScript version conflict in frontend package.json (changed from 5.8.3 to 4.9.5 for compatibility with react-scripts@5.0.1)
2. Updated docker-compose.yml to use port 3002:3000 for the frontend service
3. Modified Dockerfile to force dependency resolution with --force flag
4. Successfully built the frontend locally

### Current Status
- Frontend builds successfully with the TypeScript version fix
- Docker configuration updated to use port 3002 as specified in project requirements
- All dependencies properly resolved with legacy peer deps support

### Next Steps
1. Test the Docker build and deployment to ensure everything works end-to-end
2. Verify that the frontend displays correctly on http://localhost:3002
3. Monitor for any additional TypeScript or dependency issues during development

### Testing Status
✅ Frontend builds successfully locally
✅ Dependency conflicts resolved with appropriate flags
✅ Docker configuration updated according to specifications
